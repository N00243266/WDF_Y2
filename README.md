# MyHealth+ – Responsive Website Project

## Framework
- Bootstrap 5
- Sass (partials, variables, mixins)

## Notes
This website extends a UX + Interaction Design prototype into a responsive, deployed site using Bootstrap and Sass.

## Project Description

MyHealth+ is a responsive, one-page website designed to extend the visual language of my UX + Interaction Design prototype into a functional web implementation.

The site was built using Bootstrap 5 for layout, structure, and responsiveness, and Sass for custom styling and design system control. Bootstrap components such as the navbar, grid system, cards, and forms were customised rather than used with default styles, allowing the final website to reflect a calm healthcare aesthetic.

The design was planned across two breakpoints in Figma (desktop and mobile) and translated into code using Bootstrap’s responsive utilities. Sass was used to manage colour variables, typography, spacing, reusable mixins, and modular partial files, resulting in a maintainable and scalable codebase.

The final site is responsive, consistent, and deployed for public access.
